Now that we have a [cloud platform](http://www.heroku.com/) to use, how do we get started? Well, signing up is easy, just enter your email and confirm, but what's in the Terms of Service?

<ul>
	<li>Must be 13 years or older - really? Why 13?</li>
	<li>Your account gets shut down once it reaches the hard or soft limit. Good, they won't be charging me for going over</li>
	<li>I get to own all my content, hooray</li>
</ul>
Otherwise, pretty standard stuff. Interestingly, it is an adapted version of the Google App Engine terms.

Anyway, setup time. Registering brings you to a link with quick start guide. Set up is a simple as download, install and run some command line utilities. After logging in with the command line tool, you have a plethora of tutorials for all sorts of languages.

Even better, <a href="https://github.com/heroku">Heroku's GitHub page</a> has a lot more examples, including a <a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-grails">Grails example</a> that I plan on looking into next.
