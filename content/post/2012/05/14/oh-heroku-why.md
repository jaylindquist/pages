In a sad turn of events, I managed to get a test app running using Java, added it to Git and uploaded to Heroku. It was only then that I realized I need to "Verify" my account before being able to run my application.

Fair enough. Google app engine sends a text message to your phone in order to verify an account. When I originally set it up, I was unable to get the text message to work, so I filled out a form and received access the next day. I liked this - no need to provide any payment information for a service I have no plans to pay for.

Heroku takes a different approach. Verifying your account must be done by handing over a credit card. If you don't want to provide payment information to a company you don't plan on paying, then you can consult the <a title="Account Verification" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/account-verification">FAQ</a>:

Hmm, not with the amount of credit card breaches that have been happening in the last few year. Especially if you are providing a free service, I don't see why you need to verify via credit card, which will be kept on file in order to provide an easy way to upgrade services in the future.

Of course, credit card verification for free accounts is their call, and it isn't like I can complain as I would be using their resources and not paying for it anyway. They do look like they have a good setup: free limited account, a lot of languages to choose from and a slick, easy to use UI.

If I ever want to do some serious cloud hosting, they will be on the top of the list, but for free, I'll stick with places that don't need the credit information.
